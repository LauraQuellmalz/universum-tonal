# .lastfm

I really like my music statistics and how they correlate with my personal life. Unfortunally the reports from last.fm are not really useable because I'm stingy and don't want to pay for data which is basically mine. To learn more about data handling, plots and solidify my math skills I want to fetch the public available data and see what I come up with. At first I just want to have the same reports provided by last.fm

Oh, and there is no goal here. I just want to get more comfortable in the tools I use for future experiments.
